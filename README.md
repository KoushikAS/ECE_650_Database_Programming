# Project #4: Database Programming - Implementation Overview
ECE 650 â€“ Spring 2022

## Project Description
This project involved the creation of a PostgreSQL database named `ACC_BBALL`, tailored to store and manage data related to ACC basketball teams. It was developed and tested on a Linux Virtual Machine using Ubuntu 20.04. The main goal was to facilitate complex queries about player statistics and team attributes through a well-structured database.

## Key Features
- **Database Creation**: Implemented in C++ to set up and initialize tables in the `ACC_BBALL` database.
- **Data Ingestion**: Developed a routine to read data from provided text files (`player.txt`, `team.txt`, `state.txt`, `color.txt`) and populate the database tables.
- **Query Interface**: Created a C++ library offering functions to interact with the database, enabling the addition of new data and fetching specific information.
- **User Authentication**: Configured database access for the user `postgres` with a predefined password.

## Database Schema
The database comprises four primary tables:
- `PLAYER`: Contains player-specific details and game statistics.
- `TEAM`: Stores information about different basketball teams.
- `STATE`: Lists U.S. states with corresponding IDs.
- `COLOR`: Details of color IDs and their respective names.

## Implementation Details
### Main Components
- `main.cpp`: Manages database setup, table creation, and data insertion.
- `query_funcs.cpp` and `query_funcs.h`: Functions for database queries and data manipulation.
- `exerciser.cpp` and `exerciser.h`: Used for testing and demonstrating database queries.

### Setup and Configuration
- PostgreSQL installation along with the `libpqxx-dev` package for C++ integration.
- Use of `sudo apt-get install` commands for environment setup.

### Testing and Validation
- Implementation of `diff -w output.txt validation.txt` for output comparison and validation.
- Ensured SQL output headers matched the table attribute definitions as per project specifications.

## Reflections and Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in setting up and managing a PostgreSQL database.
- Learned the intricacies of database programming and data handling in C++.
- Understood the importance of precise query functions in database interaction.
